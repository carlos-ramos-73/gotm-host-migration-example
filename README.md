# gotm-host-migration-example
Open source example on how to use gotm's plugin API to do host migration.
Host migration happens when the host leaves, and you do not want the players to leave as well.
This example is applied in a lobby but the same concept can be applied in-game.

To test this example, you can upload the export.pck into gotm or use this link to test:
